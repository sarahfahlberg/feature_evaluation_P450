# feature_evaluation_P450
# 
# This project evaluates two different methods for encoding protein sequences and their affects on
# a machine learning algorithm's ability to learn accurately and quickly about the protein
# sequence-function relationships. Final results can be viewed in the research report or by running 
# the script generature_ML_curves.ipyn
#
# Please see paper for descriptions on how scripts work and sources of the learned embeddings
# Email sfahlberg@wisc.edu for any questions or concerns
